Work in progress trail map for Pebble Beach, based on gps tracks that I've recorded.

Main KML is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-gibson/pb-trails/master/PB%20Trails.kml). Unconfirmed trails (from gps data downloaded from web, aerial photos) can be found in [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-gibson/pb-trails/master/Unconfirmed.kml).
